#PharmaNear

PharmaNear is a location-aware pharmaceutical discovery platform that enables customers to search for medical products available in nearby verified pharmacies and medical sellers.

The system is designed with a strong focus on trust, compliance, and accessibility, ensuring that only approved and verified sellers can list and distribute products on the platform.

PharmaNear supports multiple actors with clearly separated roles, including guest customers, registered sellers, and system administrators. sellers undergo a document-based verification process before gaining access to operational features, while customers can discover products without friction.
