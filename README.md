#PharmaNear

PharmaNear is a location-aware pharmaceutical discovery platform that enables customers to search for medical products available in nearby verified pharmacies and medical businesses.

The system is designed with a strong focus on trust, compliance, and accessibility, ensuring that only approved and verified businesses can list and distribute products on the platform.

PharmaNear supports multiple actors with clearly separated roles, including guest customers, registered businesses, and system administrators. Businesses undergo a document-based verification process before gaining access to operational features, while customers can discover products without friction.
